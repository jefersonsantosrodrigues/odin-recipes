      <p> Don't call the Chinese takeaway! make your own egg-fried rice. Use leftover rice, or cook and dry it on a
        plate before using so it doesn't stick to the wok.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>250g long grain rice </li>
             <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
             <li>1 onion, finely chopped </li>
             <li> 4 eggs, beaten</li>
             <li> 2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</li>
         </ul>

    <h4> Directions:</h4>
         <ol>
              <li> STEP 1

             Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside. </li>
              <li> STEP 2

              Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned,
              around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.
              </li>
             <li>STEP 3

                Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice â€“ stir
               vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before
               breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You
              can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.
